[FOCUS](http://www.focus-em.org): High throughput processing of the image stacks recorded by electron microscopes
======

**About**  
A Graphical User Interface designed using C++ and Qt5 with following features:  
* An import tool which can continuously monitor the new images
* Scripts which can process these images using in-house and external software. It is easy for the users to define more scripts if required
* A parallel batch queue processor which transfers processing of the scripts to different resources available on the system
* A library which summaries the statistics of the collected images
* A website which can be used to continuously monitor the status of the recorded images

**Supported Modes**  
Focus supports different type of electron microscopy projects which can be set when setting up a new project. Current supported modes are:  
* Drift correction only
* Single Particle with drift correction
* 2D Electron Crystallography with drift correction
* Electron tomography with drift correction
