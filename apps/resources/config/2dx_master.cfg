# This file represents the data processing database. 
# All processing parameters for individual images are stored in copies of this file. The copies are then called 2dx_image.cfg.
# The merging directory also uses a copy of this file, which is then called 2dx_merge.cfg.
# Upon launching, FOCUS does the following:
# It reads the system-wide root version of this file, which could for example reside in /usr/local/focus/resources/config/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the personal choice, usually stored in ~/.2dx/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the project wide database, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/merge/2dx_merge.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with the tilt-angle specific databases, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA00/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with the image-specific values, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA00/ProtA0012345601/2dx_image.cfg, 
# .... but it ONLY does the latter update, if the parameter "SYNC_WITH_UPPER_LEVEL" is not set to "YES".
# This results in the loaded database that FOCUS keeps in RAM memory, until you press the SAVE icon on that program. 
#
# If you want to process one additional image, it will be initialized with a copy of the 2dx_master.cfg file one level above. You can there define your default starting values for the parameters for these images, e.g. define kV, Cs, defocus, pixel size, etc.. once for the entire processing batch.
#
# If you want to update the database by adding one additional parameter, you should do that on the system-wide file in /usr/local/focus/resources/config/2dx_master.cfg. Upon opening FOCUS and saving the database, you then have added that parameter to your local working file.

For a CCD camera, this value is typically 10 to 25 micrometer. For a TEM, the CCD camera can produce images of a different magnification than the screen, due to a so-called post-magnification between screen and CCD. You have to either give the exact CCD camera pixel size, and then specify as "magnification" the real magnification between sample and CCD, including any "post-magnification", or you have to give as "CCD pixel size" a value that takes the post-magnification into account. In this case, give as CCD pixel size the size that would correspond to a CCD pixel on the screen. In micrometer.

These should be smaller than the reciprocal lattice vector length, in order to avoid overlap of adjacent spots. Smaller values for the Fourier space radii correspond to a larger diameter of the effective real space reference, meaning less sensitive unbending with a larger reference patch. Or: Larger values here in Fourier space correspond to a smaller real space reference, which means that the unbending can follow finer details in the 2D crystal. This SYN_maskb radius is used for creation of the cross-correlation map that is used in the third quadsearch run, after the ERROR field of the first two quadserch runs has been established with the SYN_maska values. This SYN_maskb value should be larger than the first SYN_maska.

For an ALAT of 200A, this should be 0.0025. You can use a larger value for this parameter if you have only non-tilted reference data but want to align tilted image data to your reference. In this case, a larger zstarwin of e.g. 0.1 gives you a larger vertical search range in Fourier space, so that for your tilted data a reference can be found from the non-tilted data. Once you have a 3D Fourier volume as reference available, you can reduce the zstarwin to smaller values, e.g. 0.02 and then 0.01 to allow a finer diversification of lattice line details.

For example, if your 2D crystal has P4212 symmetry, in single-particle refinement you would like to apply C4 symmetry.

# LEGEND: Particles are picked according to the position and score of the cross-correlation peaks found in the unbending steps. Here, the user should set a threshold on the score of the CC peaks, in multiples of standard deviations, to include particles in the dataset. Higher CC scores, in general, represent good particles. If you want to pick all particles with score above average, this should be set to 0.0. If you want to include nearly all particles, this should be set to e.g. -3.0, which means "all particles with score higher than 3 standard deviations below the average will be included". If you want to be strict, set this to a positive number, e.g. 1.0.

# LABEL: How to split particles in half-sets?
# LEGEND: In single-particle refinements, map quality is evaluated based on the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curve, which requires the data to be randomly split into two half-sets. This parameter allows to select if the dataset should be split on a particle-basis (each half-set contains half of the particles from all 2D crystals) or on a crystal-basis (each half-set contains all particles from half of the 2D crystals). Default is crystal-based, to avoid spurious correlations due to overlapping particle boxes. WARNING: this method may exclude some particles at random from your dataset to ensure that the two half-sets are balanced.

# LABEL: Shuffle order of particles?
# LEGEND: This parameter allows to select if particles should be picked from the 2D crystals in random order. If splitting the dataset in random halves on a particle basis (see above), this should always be set to 'y'. If splitting data on a crystal-basis, this variable does should not matter for the refinement, but it's still important in order to remove spurious correlations from FRC plots for the crystal averages. Therefore, this variable should only be set to 'n' for diagnostics purposes.

# LABEL: Radius for normalization?
# LEGEND: The standard deviation (Sigma) and average to be used for normalizing the individual particles will be calculated only outside a disk with this radius (in fraction of half the box size), only used if SPR_NormalizeBox = "y". For example: if your box size is 100 x 100 pixels and you want that only the pixels outside a disk with 90 pixels diameter be used to calculate the normalization, then specify '0.90' here. This is important for compatibility with RELION. If you want that the whole particle image be used to calculate the normalization, then specify a negative value here (e.g. -1).

# LABEL: CTF correction: micrograph-based or particle-based?
# LEGEND: This parameter allows to select whether CTF correction should be performed on the whole micrograph prior to particle picking, or on the particle box directly. Whole-micrograph CTF correction is better in preventing signal delocalization effects, but is also much slower.
