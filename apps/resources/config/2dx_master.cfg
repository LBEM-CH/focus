# This file represents the data processing database.
# All processing parameters for individual images are stored in copies of this file. The copies are then called 2dx_image.cfg.
# The merging directory also uses a copy of this file, which is then called 2dx_merge.cfg.
# Upon launching, FOCUS does the following:
# It reads the system-wide root version of this file, which could for example reside in /usr/local/focus/resources/config/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the personal choice, usually stored in ~/.2dx/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the project wide database, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/merge/2dx_merge.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with the tilt-angle specific databases, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA00/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with the image-specific values, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA00/ProtA0012345601/2dx_image.cfg,
# .... but it ONLY does the latter update, if the parameter "SYNC_WITH_UPPER_LEVEL" is not set to "YES".
# This results in the loaded database that FOCUS keeps in RAM memory, until you press the SAVE icon on that program.
#
# If you want to process one additional image, it will be initialized with a copy of the 2dx_master.cfg file one level above. You can there define your default starting values for the parameters for these images, e.g. define kV, Cs, defocus, pixel size, etc.. once for the entire processing batch.
#
# If you want to update the database by adding one additional parameter, you should do that on the system-wide file in /usr/local/focus/resources/config/2dx_master.cfg. Upon opening FOCUS and saving the database, you then have added that parameter to your local working file.

For a CCD camera, this value is typically 10 to 25 micrometer. For a TEM, the CCD camera can produce images of a different magnification than the screen, due to a so-called post-magnification between screen and CCD. You have to either give the exact CCD camera pixel size, and then specify as "magnification" the real magnification between sample and CCD, including any "post-magnification", or you have to give as "CCD pixel size" a value that takes the post-magnification into account. In this case, give as CCD pixel size the size that would correspond to a CCD pixel on the screen. In micrometer.

So, in a cryo-EM image protein should be black on white background. In a negative stain image protein should be white on dark background. In both cases, you want a final map that shows white protein on dark background. To achieve this, leave this parameter on "no" for cryo-EM images, and set it to "yes" for neg. stain images. That way, protein is in cryo-EM images black, and after CTF correction white, and in neg. stain images protein is white, after CTF correction black, and due to this switch will again be inverted to white.  In every case, you want white protein at the end.

# LABEL: How to split particles in half-sets?
# LEGEND: In single-particle refinements, map quality is evaluated based on the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curve, which requires the data to be randomly split into two half-sets. This parameter allows to select if the dataset should be split on a particle-basis (each half-set contains half of the particles from all 2D crystals) or on a crystal-basis (each half-set contains all particles from half of the 2D crystals). Default is crystal-based, to avoid spurious correlations due to overlapping particle boxes. WARNING: this method may exclude some particles at random from your dataset to ensure that the two half-sets are balanced.
# EXAMPLE: SPR_WhichHalfSet  = "crystal-based"

# LABEL: Shuffle order of particles?
# LEGEND: This parameter allows to select if particles should be picked from the 2D crystals in random order. If splitting the dataset in random halves on a particle basis (see above), this should always be set to 'y'. If splitting data on a crystal-basis, this variable does should not matter for the refinement, but it's still important in order to remove spurious correlations from FRC plots for the crystal averages. Therefore, this variable should only be set to 'n' for diagnostics purposes.

# LABEL: Radius for normalization?
# LEGEND: The standard deviation (Sigma) and average to be used for normalizing the individual particles will be calculated only outside a disk with this radius (in fraction of half the box size), only used if SPR_NormalizeBox = "y". For example: if your box size is 100 x 100 pixels and you want that only the pixels outside a disk with 90 pixels diameter be used to calculate the normalization, then specify '0.90' here. This is important for compatibility with RELION. If you want that the whole particle image be used to calculate the normalization, then specify a negative value here (e.g. -1).

"Defocus" will use the tilt geometry based on the defocus gradient for all images. "Lattice" will use the tilt geometry based on the lattice for all images. "Merge" will use the same tilt geometry used for the last 3D merging. This is especially useful if tilt geometry refinement has been performed in 3D merging.

# LABEL: CTF correction: micrograph-based or particle-based?
# LEGEND: This parameter allows to select whether CTF correction should be performed on the whole micrograph prior to particle picking, or on the particle box directly.

"non-corrected" is the particle stack that has not been corrected for CTF, e.g. "particles.mrcs", which you should use if you want FREALIGN and RELION to perform CTF correction internally;  "phase-flipped" if CTF was corrected by phase-flipping; "ctf-multiplied" if CTF was corrected by Wiener-filtering.; "wiener-filtered" if CTF was corrected by Wiener-filtering.

# LABEL: Calculate FRC for crystal averages?
# LEGEND: If selected, the particles from each crystal will be split into two random subsets from which a Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC) curve will be computed. This may be useful for assessing the quality of each crystal or crystal average. The FRC plots can be found under merge/SPR/FRC/. Keep in mind that computing FRCs slows down the crystal averaging process.
